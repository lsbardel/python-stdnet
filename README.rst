**Object data mapper and advanced query manager for non relational databases.**

The data is owned by different, configurable back-end databases and it is
accessed using a light-weight Object Data Mapper (ODM). The ODM presents a
method of associating user-defined Python classes with database **collections**,
and instances of those classes with **items** in their corresponding collections.
Collections and items are different for different backend databases but
are treated in the same way in the python language domain.

Features
=================
* Models with scalar and multi-value fields.
* Rich query API including unions, intersections, exclusions, ranges and more.
* Minimal server round-trips via backend scripting (lua for redis).
* Full text search.
* Signals handling to allow decoupled applications to get notified on changes.
* Synchronous and asynchronous database connection.
* Multi-variate numeric timeseries application.
* Asynchronous Publish/Subscribe application.
* 90% Test coverage.
* Fully documented.

Requirements
=================
* Python 3.6 and up


Philosophy
===============
Key-valued pairs databases, also know as key-value stores, have many differences
from traditional relational databases,
most important being they do not use ``SQL`` as their query language,
storage does not require a fixed table schemas and usually they do not support
complex queries.

Stdnet aims to accommodate a flexible schema and join type operations via
a lightweight object data mapper.
Importantly, it is designed with large data sets in mind. You pull data
you need, nothing more, nothing less.
Bandwidth and server round-trips can be reduced to the bare minimum
so that your application is fast and memory efficient.


Installing
================================
To install, download, uncompress and type::

    python setup.py install

otherwise use ``easy_install``::

    easy_install python-stdnet

or ``pip``::

    pip install python-stdnet


Version Check
======================
To know which version you have installed::

    >>> import stdnet
    >>> stdnet.__version__
    '0.8.0'
    >>> stdnet.VERSION
    stdnet_version(major=0, minor=8, micro=0, releaselevel='final', serial=1)


Backends
====================
Backend data-stores are the backbone of the library.
Currently the list is limited to

* Redis_ 2.6 or above.


Object Data Mapper
================================
The ``stdnet.odm`` module is the ODM, it maps python objects into database data
and vice-versa. It is design to be fast and safe to use::

    from stdnet import odm

    class Base(odm.StdModel):
        '''An abstract model. This won't have any data in the database.'''
        name = odm.SymbolField(unique = True)
        ccy  = odm.SymbolField()

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.name

        class Meta:
            abstract = True


    class Instrument(Base):
        itype = odm.SymbolField()


    class Fund(Base):
        description = odm.CharField()


    class PositionDescriptor(odm.StdModel):
        dt    = odm.DateField()
        size  = odm.FloatField()
        price = odm.FloatField()
        position = odm.ForeignKey("Position", index=False)


    class Position(odm.StdModel):
        instrument = odm.ForeignKey(Instrument, related_name='positions')
        fund       = odm.ForeignKey(Fund)
        history    = odm.ListField(model=PositionDescriptor)

        def __unicode__(self):
            return '%s: %s @ %s' % (self.fund,self.instrument,self.dt)



Register models with backend::

    models = orm.Router('redis://localhost?db=1')
    models.register(Instrument)
    models.register(Fund)
    models.register(PositionDescriptor,'redis://localhost?db=2')
    models.register(Position,'redis://localhost?db=2')

And play with the API::

    >>> f = models.fund.new(name="pluto, description="The pluto fund", ccy="EUR")
    >>> f
    Fund: pluto

Running Tests
======================
At the moment, only redis back-end is available and therefore to run tests you
need to install Redis_. If you are using linux, it can be achieved simply
by downloading, uncompressing and running ``make``, if you are using
windows you can find sources from MSOpenTech_.

Requirements for running tests:

* ``python-stdnet`` project directory.
* pulsar_.

To run tests open a shell and launch Redis. On another shell,
from within the ``python-stdnet`` package directory, type::

    python runtests.py

Tests are run against a local redis server on port ``6379`` and database 7 by default.
To change the server and database where to run tests pass the ``--server``
option as follow::

    python runtests.py --server redis://myserver.com:6450?db=12&password=bla

For more information type::

    python runtests.py -h


.. _kudos:

Kudos
=============
* Redis_ simply because this library uses its awesome features.
* SQLAlchemy_ and Django_ for ideas and API design.
